## Server Wrapper
admin-wrapper-title = SERVER WRAPPER
admin-wrapper-lead = Agent installer and supervisor for game servers
admin-wrapper-setup-intro = ServerWrapper installs the right agent for your server, wires up authlib-injector, and keeps the server visible in the launcher while it boots. It is an installer and a supervisor — access control itself stays on the master.
admin-wrapper-setup-not-built = Not built yet — run ./gradlew collectAgents in agent/ and copy agent/build/agents/ into {NORO_DATA_DIR}/agents/.
admin-wrapper-setup-step2-desc = The agent secret is issued per game server in the build admin panel, section Game servers. It lives here and nowhere else — the wrapper passes it to the server process itself.
admin-wrapper-setup-step2-min = That is the minimum. NeoForge and Forge start from an args file, not a jar — pass it with a leading @, for example server-jar=@libraries/net/neoforged/neoforge/21.1.248/unix_args.txt, and keep their own JVM file as jvm-args=@user_jvm_args.txt. Every other option is listed below.
admin-wrapper-setup-step3-desc = The wrapper detects the platform and Minecraft version, installs the matching agent, verifies its signature, and launches the server.
admin-wrapper-setup-step4-desc = Sessions are validated against this master, so the server must stay in online mode.

admin-wrapper-opt-master-url = Master node address. A trailing slash is stripped.
admin-wrapper-opt-secret = Agent secret for this game server, issued in the build admin panel under Game servers. Must start with noroagent_. Lives only here — the wrapper hands it to the server process through an environment variable.
admin-wrapper-opt-server-jar = Server jar, relative to server-dir. Starts with @ for an args file instead — NeoForge and Forge launch that way: @libraries/net/neoforged/neoforge/21.1.248/unix_args.txt
admin-wrapper-opt-signing-public-key = Master ed25519 key, hex. Empty means fetch once and pin to noro/signing-key.pub; a later change becomes a hard error. Set it explicitly in production — a pinned key here is the real trust anchor.
admin-wrapper-opt-server-dir = Server directory. Everything else resolves against it, and the agent goes into its plugins/ or mods/.
admin-wrapper-opt-java = Java binary. Point it at a specific JDK when the default one is the wrong version for this Minecraft release.
